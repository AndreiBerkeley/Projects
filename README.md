# Project Description

1. News_Fecther: This project automates the' collection, summarization, and email distribution of cryptocurrency-related news articles. It leverages the Newspaper3k library for web scraping, SpaCy for text summarization, and SMTP for email automation, integrating these components to process and share relevant blockchain news efficiently.

2. Combined_Fetcher: This project automates the collection, processing, and analysis of blockchain gaming data from multiple sources such as DappRadar, Artemis, and CoinGecko. It utilizes APIs, web scraping, and data processing techniques with Pandas and OpenPyXL to compile insights into an organized Excel report for further analysis.

3. SampleVersion: This project is a Summer Program Matcher that helps students find the most suitable summer programs based on their grade level, subjects of interest, and personal preferences. It employs fuzzy matching for text processing, NLP-based semantic similarity scoring with Sentence-BERT, and keyword extraction using KeyBERT to rank programs, ensuring personalized recommendations.

4. ManualAnnotations: Create a Multi-Agent System Manual Taxonomy to help improve general error detection in agent pipelines.
